    "#### What is Pneumothorax disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "A pneumothorax is when the lung has collapsed due to air entering the space around your lungs (known as the pleural space). In a healthy body, the lungs are touching the walls of the chest. Air can enter the pleural space through an opening in your chest wall or in the lung. Air in the pleural space creates an increase in pressure around the lung and causes it to collapse. The lung may fully collapse, but most often only a part of it collapses. This collapse can also put pressure on the heart, causing further symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pneumothorax can be severe, depending on how much air is trapped in the pleural space. A small amount of trapped air can usually resolve by itself, provided there are no other complications. Larger amounts of trapped air can be serious and lead to death if medical treatment is not obtained."

    "## Causes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Primary spontaneous: \n",
    "Primary spontaneous pneumothorax(PSP) occurs in young people (aged 15-34) without any history of lung disease. The direct cause of PSP is unknown. People at risk include smokers, tall men and those who have had a family member with a pneumothorax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Secondary spontaneous:\n",
    "Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) can be caused by a variety of lung diseases(such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis,  pneumonia, lung cancer, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis or cystic lung diseases) and tissue disorders(such as Marfanâ€™s Syndrome). SSP carries more serious symptoms than PSP, and it is more likely to cause death.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Traumatic pneumothorax:\n",
    "A traumatic pneumothorax is the result of an impact or injury. Potential causes include blunt trauma or an injury that damages the chest wall and pleural space.\n",
    "One of the most common ways this occurs is when someone fractures a rib. The sharp points of the broken bone can puncture the chest wall and damage lung tissue. Other causes include sports injuries, car accidents, and puncture or stab wounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Tension pneumothorax\n",
    "Tension pneumothorax is caused by a leak in the pleural space that resembles a one-way valve. As a person inhales, the air leaks into the pleural space and becomes trapped. It cannot be released during an exhale. This process leads to increased air pressure in the pleural space that is life-threatening and needs immediate treatment."
